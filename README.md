# CI/CD API
Continuous Integration & Delivery .NET 6 API for GitHub and Docker Container.

## Description
On one hand, this API is meant to work as a Continuous Integration tool getting .NET Core source code from GitHub and building it locally (and optionally running tests).  
On the other hand, it works with a powershell script in order to deploy this code on a local Docker Container.

## References
Please, refer to "CICD API.pdf" document to get more details about how does it work.

Download Angular web UI at [CI/CD Web](https://github.com/rlrecalde/CICD_Web) in order to make it work easily.
